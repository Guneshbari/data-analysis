## 📌 Overview

This repository contains exploratory and data-cleaning–focused Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate practical approaches to preparing and understanding datasets.

Each notebook represents a focused learning exercise rather than a fully polished production pipeline.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice real-world data cleaning techniques
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create meaningful visual representations of data
- Build reproducible and readable notebooks
- Strengthen fundamentals of Python-based data analysis

---

## 📓 Notebooks

### 1. BearCart Data Cleaning

**File:** `BearCart_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`

- Inspect and clean raw datasets
- Handle missing and inconsistent values
- Normalize and validate data for further analysis

---

### 2. Visual Representation

**File:** `VisualRepresentation.ipynb`

- Explore datasets using visualization techniques
- Generate plots and charts to identify patterns
- Translate raw data into understandable insights

---

## 🔄 Workflow

Typical steps followed across notebooks:

- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing or invalid values
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis
- Visualization and interpretation

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
